			<string>After my high school graduation in 2008, I first did a voluntary, three-month internship in the asset management department of a big real estate company in Oberhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia. I learned a lot during my internship there, especially that I didn&apos;t want to study business ;-)</string>
			<string>In November 2008, I started my civil service, which I did in a bilingual kindergarden (the languages were German and English). The civil service at that time was mandatory for those male high school graduates that didn&apos;t want to join the military for 9 month and chose to work in a social insitution instead.</string>
			<string>I love working (or rather playing :-) with children! At that time, I even became the babysitter in multiple families who had at least one of their children in that kindergarden.</string>

			<string>In the eleventh grade, I decided to go abroad for one year. At that time, I had learned French in school for three years and liked it a lot, this was one of the main reasons why I picked France as the target country for my year abroad.</string>
			<string> The year was organized by a school exchange organisation called AFS. I lived in a very nice host family and went to a regular French high scool. My host brother once took me to his fencing practice - I immediately got addicted to it and trained four times a week for the rest of the year.</string>
			<string>All in all I met a lot of nice people and had a very exciting and fun year! Looking back this was one of the greatest times of my life!</string>

			<string>One year after my high school graduation, after having finished my civil service, I enrolled in a  Bachelor program in Business Information Technology at the University of Mannheim. Studying in Mannheim is just great, the university&apos;s main building is an actual castle.</string>
			<string>Until then I was always fascinated by computers, but hadn&apos;t written a single line of code. Once I started to learn programming, I quickly got addicted to it. My favorite class in the three years of the Bachelor was &quot;Software Engineering&quot;, which we had in our fourth semester. In this class, next to a theoretical lecture, students had to work on a group project and build a bank depot management system.</string>
			<string>The software had to be written in Java (the GUI was developed with the Swing framework) and was connected to an REST interface that was provided by our instructors to get access the recent stock prices.</string>

			<string>After having finished my Bachelor studies, I continued right away with the Master program which I will finish in January 2015. I am enjoying my studies a lot, Master students have to chose one of three so-called specialization tracks. I chose the track &quot;System Design &amp; Development&quot; and focusses on the software engineering process and everything that is related to it (the other two tracks are &quot;Information Technology&quot; and &quot;E-Commerce&quot;).</string>
			<string>In the first two semesters of my Master, I was working on a team project, which students are required to do at my university. With a team of a total of five students, we developed a distributed &quot;Patient scheduling&quot; simulation tool that was based on Agent technology. The tool was developed in Java and built on top of the Agent framework JADE, it can be used to analyze and compare different patient scheduling coordination mechanisms.</string>
			<string>I still love being in Mannheim, I made a lot of friends there and I am living in an apartment that I share with three other guys, two of which I met during my very first day at the univeristy in August 2008.</string>

			<string>Right after my Bachelor graduation, I switched from the department &quot;Master Data Governance&quot; where I wrote my Bachelor thesis to the department &quot;IT Mobile - Center of Excellence (CoE)&quot;, my team was concerned with building SAP internal apps that were to be used by employees.</string>
			<string>From June until August I developed my first real iOS app, it was called &quot;MyStaffingList&quot; and was intented to be used mostly by SAP consultants to help them getting an overview of their current staffings and projects. The app ran against an SAP backend with a REST interface.</string>
			<string>In the following year I was implementing one prototype for an app idea in our team, was responsible for maintenance of the &quot;MyStaffingList&quot; app and was helping out in a couple of bigger projects within my team.</string>

			<string>During my semester abroad in Seoul, I met another German guy. He studied Business in the city of Muenster, but originally he came from Hamburg, just like me. At that time, he was working for a start-up with a few friends from him from Hamburg. They were developing an iPhone app that combined instant messaging with a &quot;friends finding&quot; function, called LetsMapp.</string>
			<string>I joined the team whithout practical experience on iOS at a point in time when the iPhone app was basically already done. The app worked very well, users could log in with Facebook and then see all their friends that were also using the app on a map. The major drawback of the app was its battery consumption as we were doing regular GPS updates so that movements of friends would be visible.</string>
			<string>We put a lot of effort into optimizing the algorithm for updating locations to save battery power. After we returned to Germany, I helped building the website, but after returning to Mannheim I had to focus on finishing my Bachelor and writing my thesis so I stopped my activities for LetsMapp after about 5 month on the team.</string>

			<string>In the third semester of my Master, I decided once more to go abroad. After having been to Seoul during my Bachelor studies, this time I chose a closer destination, Amsterdam! I loved the city from the first day, life quality there is very high! I didn&apos;t want to live in the student dorms this time, so I tackled apartment search in Amsterdam.</string>
			<string>Little did I know that this is a challenging task in Amsterdam, especially with a student budget. Luckily I had my job at Cameramanager to be able to afford rooms. During my whole stay, I couldn&apos;t find a permanent place, so over the whole period that I have been staying in Amsterdam I lived in four different appartments with different roommates.</string>
			<string>I studied at the Vrije Universiteit, my classes were very interesting and I learned a lot! One class was called &quot;Internet Programming&quot;, in this class we had to deliver bi-weekly programming assignments that we usually had to write in C and where we were exploring the C networking API. I could even reuse the knowledge I gained during the course for implementing the Camera sniffer for the Camermanager iOS app (in my opinion the most challenging feature I ever build :-).</string>

			<string>For the time of my studies in Amsterdam, I applied for a job as iOS developer at a few companies. After a Skype interview and one visit at their office in Amsterdam, I signed a working contract at Cameramanager. In August, when my classes at the Vrije Universeit Amsterdam (VU) hadn&apos;t yet started, I worked full-time. After that, I reduced my work time a bit depending on the current workload that I had for my classes at the VU.</string>
			<string>Cameramanager offers camera surveillance with IP cameras that can be managed in the cloud. Just before I started working there, the company had been acquired by Panasonic. When I started the job, the company already had an iOS app in the App Store, but had just decided to build a completely new interface for it.</string>
			<string>I was the only iOS developer in the company, I looked at the code from the old app, was shocked and decided to start the new app from scratch. I tried to reuse as much code as possible from the old app, which finally came down to a few helper classes that I could integrate with the new UI. I managed to build and publish the first version of the (universal) app within about 2 and a half month and added many features since then.</string>

In the morning, the whole team of 30-35 pleople has been split up into smaller groups, each of which has been assigned a team lead by our two bosses. I was selected to be the lead of the &quot;Mobile and Web team&quot;, consisting of our Android developer, me and our three web developers.</string>
			<string>Just like all other teams, we had to prepare a presentation that was to be held by the team lead. At the end of the day, everyone could vote for the best presentation that was held in the morning and my presentation won in the end. The price for all team members was one day at the Mobile World Congress that took place in February in Barcelona.</string>
			<string>I flew there with my team members, ending up having a great and also very interesting time before and at the congress. I spent most of the time in a hall that was called &quot;App Planet&quot; and which was packed with interesting companies and their innovative technologies! A funny side story of the MCW is that I met an old friend of mine who I got to know during my stay in France and whom I hadn&apos;t seen for more than 7 years!</string>

            <string>I applied for a student scholarship for Apple's WWDC last year. My application consisted of a former version of this very app that you are playing right now, but its style was slightly different. It had less stories and didn't feature the 'click wheel' and the story 'preview' on the time line canvas yet.</string>
			<string>I was so excited about this opportunity and despite the fact that I still had to pay for flight and accomodation by myself, I didn't hesitate one second to take this chance. And, as you can imagine, it was totally worth it. I had a fantastic time and met lots of fantastic people.</string>
			<string>This was actually my first time in San Francisco, so I took the chance and extended my stay for a 3-day trip to Palo Alto, where I made a bike tour to the Stanford university and the Google campus in Mountain View. If at all possible, I would like to go and work somewhere in the Bay Area after my graduation this summer.</string>

3: iDeveloper Life: Scotty telling interesting iOS stories and talking to interesting guests.</string>

        <string>After having worked as a working student for SAP for more than half a year and having internally published one iOS app at SAP and worked on a few more iOS projects, I decided that it&apos;s time for me to start working on my first App Store submission. </string>
        <string>My goal was to build an app that would use CoreData for local storage, as I had never had hands-on experience with CoreData until then but wanted to know more about how it works. Building an own app in my opinion was the best occasion to get going on CoreData.</string>
        <string>So, I came up with the idea of a debt management application to keep track of borrowed or lent money. Having started with a tab bar controller, I switched to a menu slide view controller along the way. After its initial release in May last year, I unfortunately didn&apos;t have the time to build an update, maybe this will come soon.</string>
